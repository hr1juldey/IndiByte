# Scene 03: The Scale - 1.7 Billion People Affected

## Scene Description

This scene emphasizes the massive scale of the problem by visualizing 1.7 billion people affected by inappropriate dietary guidelines. It highlights the shocking statistic that 89% of Indian patients ignore dietary advice that doesn't reflect their food culture.

## Visual Elements

- Animated Earth with India highlighted in a distinct color
- Population counter showing 1.7 billion people, with numbers increasing rapidly
- Visual representation of 20% of world's population through a pie chart
- Graph showing 89% of Indian patients ignoring dietary advice
- Comparison visualization of 89% ignoring vs. 11% following
- Waves or ripple effects representing the scale of impact

## Character Animations

- Individual people icons representing the population of India
- Visual of 9 out of 10 people turning away from dietary advice
- Graphs and charts animating to show the statistics
- People icons showing various cultural backgrounds within India

## Timeline & Entry/Exit Times

- **Entry Time:** 1:30
- **Scene Duration:** 1:30 - 2:15

## Narration Match

This scene directly corresponds to the scale section in HLS.md:
> "India is home to 1.7 billion people, roughly 20% of the world's population. Yet their dietary guidelines have been based on research conducted in European and American populations. It's like trying to fit a suit made for someone else - it simply doesn't work. This has led to a startling statistic: 89% of Indian patients ignore dietary advice that doesn't reflect their food culture."
>
> "Think about that - nearly 9 out of every 10 patients are told something they can't or won't follow. This isn't because they don't care about their health, but because the recommendations are culturally irrelevant and economically inaccessible."

## Visual Metaphors

- Population scale as a massive wave or tsunami
- Dietary advice failure as a widespread epidemic
- Cultural irrelevance as a communication breakdown
- The visualization of 9 out of 10 people rejecting advice

## Transition Notes

This scene transitions to Scene 04 by focusing on the economic aspect of why patients ignore dietary advice, shifting from the scale of the problem to the reasons behind it.

## Technical Notes

- Use Kurzgesagt's signature data visualization techniques for statistics
- Implement smooth scaling animations to show population growth
- Use contrasting colors to emphasize the 89% statistic
- Ensure the visualization is clear and impactful without being overwhelming
- Include multiple representations of the same data for reinforcement
