## Narration Match

This scene directly corresponds to the vision and conclusion section in HLS.md:
> "The ultimate goal is "nutritional sovereignty" - ensuring that India's dietary standards are designed with Indian cultural context, economic reality, and nutritional needs in mind, rather than being dependent on Western models."
>
> "This isn't about rejecting scientific nutrition principles, but about applying them in a way that respects and incorporates Indian food culture. It's about making sure that when a diabetic patient in Chennai gets dietary advice, it reflects the foods they actually eat and can afford, like Rohu fish instead of salmon."
>
> "IndiByte represents a fundamental shift in nutrition science - from a one-size-fits-all global model to a culturally appropriate, locally relevant approach. It's not just an app or a database, but a new infrastructure for nutrition that respects cultural identity while providing evidence-based health recommendations."
>
> "For 1.7 billion Indians, this could mean the difference between ignoring dietary advice and following it, between healthy eating being a luxury and being accessible, between nutrition science being foreign and being familiar. It's about making sure that the science of healthy eating finally aligns with the reality of Indian plates."
>
> "The story of IndiByte is ultimately about respect - respect for traditional knowledge, respect for cultural preferences, and respect for the economic reality of ordinary people trying to eat healthily. It's a story of creating technology that serves people in their own context, not asking people to change their context to serve technology."

## Visual Metaphors
