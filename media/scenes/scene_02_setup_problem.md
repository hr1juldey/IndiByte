# Scene 02: The Setup - A Perfectly Logical Problem

## Scene Description

This scene establishes the foundational problem of standardized nutrition science that ignores cultural context. It visually demonstrates how global dietary advice is applied uniformly regardless of local cultural practices and food availability.

## Visual Elements

- Global restaurant chain logo with uniform menu worldwide
- Split screen showing identical dietary advice being given to different populations
- Visual of a doctor in Chennai giving advice to a patient
- Contrast between generic "healthy" foods (salmon) and local alternatives (Rohu fish)
- Price tags showing the cost difference
- Flowchart showing how standardized advice flows to different cultures

## Character Animations

- Doctor figure providing generic dietary advice
- Patient looking confused and unable to follow the advice
- Visual representation of the patient's thought process showing unavailable or unaffordable foods
- Cultural disconnect visualized as people turning away from advice

## Timeline & Entry/Exit Times

- **Entry Time:** 0:45
- **Scene Duration:** 0:45 - 1:30
- **Exit Time:** 1:30

## Narration Match

This scene directly corresponds to the setup section in HLS.md:
> "For decades, nutrition science has been like a global restaurant chain using one menu worldwide. Whether you're in Mumbai or Minnesota, the dietary advice is largely the same. This makes perfect sense from a standardization perspective, but it completely ignores where we actually eat from - your plate, not the pantry."
>
> "In India, this mismatch creates a perfect storm of problems. When a doctor in Chennai tells a diabetic patient to eat "healthy" foods, they often recommend expensive Western alternatives like salmon instead of locally available, culturally familiar Rohu fish. This recommendation is nutritionally sound on paper, but practically useless in reality."

## Visual Metaphors

- Nutrition science as a global restaurant chain
- Dietary advice as a one-size-fits-all menu
- Cultural disconnect as "trying to fit a suit made for someone else"
- The concept of "your plate, not the pantry"

## Transition Notes

This scene transitions to Scene 03 by emphasizing the scale of the problem, zooming in from a single patient interaction to the broader impact on 1.7 billion people.

## Technical Notes

- Use contrasting colors to show the difference between local and foreign foods
- Include visual indicators of cultural and economic inaccessibility
- Show the doctor-patient interaction with empathy to highlight the human impact
- Implement smooth transitions between different visual metaphors
