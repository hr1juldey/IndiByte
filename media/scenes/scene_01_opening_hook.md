# Scene 01: Opening Hook - The Architectural Mismatch Metaphor

## Scene Description

This scene introduces the core problem using the analogy of architectural blueprints designed for one climate being applied to a completely different environment. The animation visually demonstrates the absurdity of applying a one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition.

## Visual Elements

- Split-screen animation showing two cities: one in India and one in Finland
- Identical buildings being constructed in both locations despite completely different climates
- Mismatched architecture with tropical plants growing over snow-designed buildings and vice versa
- Overlay of a 1.7 billion person icon representing India's population
- Kurzgesagt's signature geometric shapes and clean design aesthetic

## Character Animations

- Construction workers building the same structures in both environments
- Citizens of each location looking confused and uncomfortable in the mismatched buildings
- Architectural blueprints transforming into dietary guidelines

## Timeline & Entry/Exit Times

- **Entry Time:** 0:00
- **Scene Duration:** 0:00 - 0:45
- **Exit Time:** 0:45

## Narration Match

This scene directly corresponds to the opening hook in HLS.md:
> "Imagine if every city in the world had to follow the same architectural blueprint designed for a completely different climate and culture. A city in India trying to use a building plan made for Finland would face endless problems. Now consider that this is exactly what's happening with nutrition for 1.7 billion Indians - trying to follow dietary guidelines made for different pantries, not their own plates."

## Visual Metaphors

- Nutrition guidelines as architectural blueprints
- Cultural mismatch as climate mismatch
- The absurdity of applying one system globally
- The vast scale of the problem (1.7 billion people)

## Transition Notes

This scene will transition to Scene 02 by transforming the architectural blueprints into dietary guidelines, maintaining the visual metaphor while shifting the context from architecture to nutrition.

## Technical Notes

- Use Kurzgesagt's signature geometric shapes throughout
- Maintain consistent color scheme with vibrant, saturated colors
- Include smooth zooming and panning to maintain visual interest
- Ensure the population scale is clearly represented with a visual element showing 1.7 billion
