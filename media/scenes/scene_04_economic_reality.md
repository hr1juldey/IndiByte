# Scene 04: The Economic Reality - When Healthy is Unaffordable

## Scene Description

This scene focuses on the economic barriers that prevent people from following dietary recommendations. It visually demonstrates how expensive Western alternatives make healthy eating a luxury rather than an accessible necessity.

## Visual Elements

- Visual comparison of food prices: Toor Dal (₹30/kg) vs. Chicken (₹250/kg) vs. Salmon (₹450/kg)
- Split screen showing expensive vs. affordable healthy options
- Wallet/budget visualization showing economic constraints
- Visual of a family choosing between expensive "healthy" food and affordable nutritious options
- Economic accessibility scale with different food items positioned according to cost
- Price tags floating over different food items

## Character Animations

- Family members looking at their budget and making difficult choices
- Price tags appearing and highlighting the cost differences
- Wallet or purse opening to show limited funds
- People looking at expensive food items but walking away due to cost

## Narration Match

This scene directly corresponds to the economic reality section in HLS.md:
> "Let's put this in economic terms. Toor Dal costs approximately ₹30/kg while chicken costs ₹250/kg. Salmon? Even more expensive. When dietary recommendations consistently favor expensive alternatives, they inadvertently make healthy eating a luxury available only to the wealthy. This creates a system where good nutrition becomes a privilege rather than a right."
>
> "The economic mismatch affects more than individual choices - it impacts entire communities. When 8% of patients follow dietary recommendations (instead of the 60% that would be expected with culturally appropriate advice), it means 92% of people are not benefiting from nutritional interventions, despite their potential to prevent diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions."

## Visual Metaphors

- Healthy eating as a luxury vs. necessity
- Economic barriers as walls preventing access to nutrition
- Price comparison as a seesaw with affordability on one side
- Good nutrition as a privilege rather than a right

## Transition Notes

This scene transitions to Scene 05 by introducing the solution - IndiByte - as a way to address these economic and cultural mismatches through technology.

## Technical Notes

- Use clear, readable text for price comparisons
- Implement visual indicators of financial constraints (empty wallets, etc.)
- Include visual elements that show the impact on families and communities
- Use color coding to differentiate between affordable and expensive options
- Ensure the economic scale is clearly visible and understandable
