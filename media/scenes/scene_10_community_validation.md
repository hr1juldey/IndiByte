## Narration Match

This scene directly corresponds to the community validation section in HLS.md:
> "Unlike proprietary systems, IndiByte operates as an open-source platform where farmers, doctors, home cooks, and nutritionists work together to validate and improve the data. This community-driven approach ensures that the platform reflects real Indian food culture rather than abstract nutritional values."
>
> "It's like having a crowd-sourced map where everyone contributes their local knowledge to create a more accurate, comprehensive picture. A farmer in Maharashtra can validate the nutritional content of local millets, while a restaurant owner in Kerala can contribute information about regional fish varieties."
