# Scene 05: The Technical Solution - Building New Infrastructure

## Scene Description

This scene introduces IndiByte as the technical solution to the problem. It visually represents the platform as new infrastructure being built to connect scientific nutrition knowledge with Indian culinary reality.

## Visual Elements

- Infrastructure construction metaphor: animated building of digital bridges
- Three interconnected gears or components representing the three parts of IndiByte
- Visual of IndiByte logo being constructed piece by piece
- Data flowing through pipelines and network pathways
- Network of computers and databases interconnecting
- Construction crane or building equipment metaphor for digital infrastructure
- Foundation and building layers representing the platform architecture

## Character Animations

- Animated construction workers building digital infrastructure
- Data packets flowing through network connections
- Components coming together to form the complete IndiByte system
- Digital construction materials transforming into functional platform elements

## Timeline & Entry/Exit Times

- **Entry Time:** 3:00
- **Scene Duration:** 3:00 - 3:45
- **Exit Time:** 3:45

## Narration Match

This scene directly corresponds to the technical solution section in HLS.md:
> "Enter IndiByte - an open-source, India-first nutrition platform designed to align dietary recommendations with Indian culinary reality. Think of it as building a new infrastructure system that connects what's actually on Indian plates with what nutrition science knows about health."
>
> "The solution has three interconnected parts:"

## Visual Metaphors

- IndiByte as building new infrastructure
- Technology as a bridge connecting science and culture
- Components as interconnected parts of a system
- Digital construction representing platform development

## Transition Notes

This scene transitions to Scene 06 by zooming into the first component - the comprehensive Indian food database - to explain it in detail.

## Technical Notes

- Use Kurzgesagt's signature geometric design for the infrastructure elements
- Show the three components clearly before diving into each one
- Implement smooth animations showing data flow between components
- Ensure the construction metaphor is clear and visually engaging
- Use appropriate color coding for different system components
