INDIBYTE starts with the INDIAN FOOD COMPOSITION TABLES...
 a DATABASE of FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT key INDIAN FOODS
published by the INDIAN COUNCIL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH.

But it goes BEYOND this...
incorporating REGIONAL VARIATIONS,
traditional ingredients like ROHU FISH and TOOR DAL,
and even the ECONOMIC TIER of each food item.
