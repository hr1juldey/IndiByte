This isn't about REJECTING SCIENTIFIC NUTRITION PRINCIPLES...
 but about APPLYING them in a way that RESPECTS 
and INCORPORATES INDIAN FOOD CULTURE.

It's about making sure that when a DIABETIC PATIENT in CHENNAI 
gets DIETARY ADVICE...
 it reflects the FOODS they actually EAT and can AFFORD...
like ROHU FISH instead of SALMON.
