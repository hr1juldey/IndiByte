Unlike PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS... 
INDIBYTE operates as an OPEN-SOURCE PLATFORM 
where FARMERS, DOCTORS, HOME COOKS, 
and NUTRITIONISTS work together 
to VALIDATE and improve the DATA.

This COMMUNITY-DRIVEN APPROACH ensures that the PLATFORM 
reflects REAL INDIAN FOOD CULTURE 
rather than ABSTRACT NUTRITIONAL VALUES.
