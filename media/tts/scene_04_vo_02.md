The ECONOMIC MISMATCH affects more than individual choices...
 it impacts ENTIRE COMMUNITIES.

When EIGHT PERCENT of patients follow DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS...
instead of the SIXTY PERCENT that would be expected
with CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE advice...
 it means NINETY-TWO PERCENT of people are not benefiting
from NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS...
despite their potential to prevent DIABETES,
HEART DISEASE, and other CONDITIONS.
