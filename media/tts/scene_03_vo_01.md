INDIA is home to ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION people...
roughly TWENTY PERCENT of the world's population.
Yet their DIETARY GUIDELINES have been based on RESEARCH
conducted in EUROPEAN and AMERICAN populations.

It's like trying to fit a SUIT made for someone else...
 it simply doesn't WORK.
This has led to a STARTLING STATISTIC:
EIGHTY-NINE PERCENT of INDIAN patients ignore DIETARY ADVICE
that doesn't reflect their food culture.
