It's like having a CROWD-SOURCED MAP...
 where EVERYONE contributes their LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 
to create a MORE ACCURATE, COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE.

A FARMER in MAHARASHTRA can VALIDATE 
the NUTRITIONAL CONTENT of LOCAL MILLETS...
while a RESTAURANT OWNER in KERALA 
can contribute INFORMATION about REGIONAL FISH VARIETIES.
