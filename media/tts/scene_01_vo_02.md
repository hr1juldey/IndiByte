For decades, NUTRITION SCIENCE has been... like a GLOBAL RESTAURANT CHAIN...
 using one MENU worldwide.
 Whether you're in MUMBAI... or MINNESOTA... the DIETARY ADVICE is largely the same.

This makes PERFECT SENSE... from a
  STANDARDIZATION perspective...
 but it completely ignores... where we actually eat from.
Your PLATE... not the PANTRY.
