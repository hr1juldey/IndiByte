For decades... NUTRITION SCIENCE has been like a GLOBAL RESTAURANT CHAIN...
 using one MENU worldwide.
 Whether you're in MUMBAI or MINNEAPOLIS...
the DIETARY ADVICE is largely the SAME.

This makes PERFECT SENSE from a STANDARDIZATION PERSPECTIVE...
 but it completely ignores where we actually eat from.
Your PLATE... not the PANTRY.
