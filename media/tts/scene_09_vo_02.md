These NUMBERS represent REAL PEOPLE making HEALTHIER CHOICES...
 because the RECOMMENDATIONS finally made SENSE
for their CULTURE and CONTEXT.

One SPECIFIC EXAMPLE: INDIBYTE'S 'DIABETES-FRIENDLY CHOLE BHATURE'...
 drove TWENTY-TWO PERCENT MORE ORDERS
than GENERIC 'healthy' options...
proving that CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS drives ADOPTION.
