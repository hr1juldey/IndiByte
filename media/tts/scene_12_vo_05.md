The STORY of INDIBYTE is ultimately about RESPECT...
RESPECT for TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE...
RESPECT for CULTURAL PREFERENCES...
and RESPECT for the ECONOMIC REALITY 
of ORDINARY PEOPLE trying to eat HEALTHILY.

It's a STORY of creating TECHNOLOGY 
that SERVES PEOPLE in their own CONTEXT...
not asking PEOPLE to CHANGE their CONTEXT 
to serve TECHNOLOGY.
