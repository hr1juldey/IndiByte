Let's put this in ECONOMIC TERMS.
TOOR DAL costs approximately THIRTY rupees per kg
while CHICKEN costs TWO FIFTY per kg.
SALMON? Even MORE EXPENSIVE.

When DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS consistently favor EXPENSIVE alternatives...
 they inadvertently make HEALTHY EATING a LUXURY available only to the WEALTHY.

This creates a SYSTEM where GOOD NUTRITION becomes a PRIVILEGE
rather than a RIGHT.
