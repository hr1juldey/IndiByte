In INDIA... this mismatch creates a PERFECT STORM of problems.
 When a DOCTOR in CHENNAI tells a DIABETIC
  patient... to eat 'healthy' foods...
 they often recommend EXPENSIVE WESTERN alternatives...
 like SALMON... instead of locally available... culturally familiar ROHU or KATLA .

This recommendation... is NUTRITIONALLY SOUND on paper...
but PRACTICALLY...
USELESS in REALITY !
