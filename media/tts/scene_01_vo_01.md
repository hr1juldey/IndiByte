Imagine... if every city in the world
had to follow the same architectural blueprint...
designed for a completely different climate and culture.

A city in INDIA...  trying to use a building plan made for FINLAND would face ENDLESS problems.

Now, consider this....
this is exactly what's happening with NUTRITION...
for ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION INDIANS.
