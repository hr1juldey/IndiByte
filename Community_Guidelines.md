## Welcome to the IndiByte Community

Welcome to the IndiByte community! We're excited to have you join us in our mission to standardize nutrition for India's culinary diversity. IndiByte is an open-source platform that aims to make culturally appropriate, accurate, and accessible nutrition information available to 1.7 billion people.

Our community is made up of diverse stakeholders including dietitians, doctors, farmers, chefs, researchers, developers, and everyday citizens who share our vision of nutrition science that reflects the Indian plate, not the pantry.

### Our Mission
To build India's most comprehensive, accurate, and culturally appropriate food nutrition database that serves the health and wellness needs of our diverse population.

### Our Vision
"Your plate, standardized. Your health, personalized."

---

## Community Values

Our community is guided by these core values that shape how we interact, contribute, and grow together:

### 1. Inclusivity
We welcome contributors from all backgrounds, regions, and walks of life. Indian cuisine is diverse, and so are we. Every voice matters in building a platform that serves 1.7 billion people.

### 2. Accuracy
We prioritize factual, evidence-based information. All health claims must be validated by credible sources, preferably ICMR-recognized authorities. Quality over quantity always.

### 3. Cultural Respect
We honor India's rich culinary traditions and regional variations. Food is deeply connected to culture, tradition, and religious practices.

### 4. Transparency
Open processes, clear communication, and accessible documentation. We believe in building trust through transparency.

### 5. Collaboration
We achieve more together than individually. Sharing knowledge, skills, and resources strengthens our collective impact.

### 6. Accessibility
Making nutrition information accessible across economic tiers and technological capabilities. No one should be excluded from accessing vital nutrition information.
