## Relevance to IndiByte
Toor Dal exemplifies IndiByte's approach of promoting culturally appropriate, economically accessible, and nutritionally valuable traditional foods. The document mentions Toor Dal as an example of how the platform would recommend economically appropriate alternatives (₹30/kg vs. chicken ₹250/kg) that are culturally aligned with Indian dietary preferences. This supports IndiByte's mission of providing cost-effective, culturally appropriate substitutions rather than expensive Western alternatives, addressing both economic and cultural barriers to following dietary advice.
