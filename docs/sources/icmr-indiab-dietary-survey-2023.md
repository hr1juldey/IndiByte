# Dietary Profiles and Metabolic Risk Factors in India (ICMR-INDIAB Survey)

## Overview
This research study, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), examines dietary profiles and associated metabolic risk factors across India. The study analyzed data from 18,090 adults as part of the ICMR-INDIAB survey, providing critical insights into India's dietary patterns and their health implications.

## Key Findings
- The study revealed that 62% of calories in Indian diets come from poor-quality carbohydrates
- Indian diets are characterized as high-carb and low-protein, which impacts health outcomes
- There are significant regional and cultural variations in dietary patterns across India
- The research links food habits and policy gaps to rising diabetes and other metabolic disorders

## Relevance to IndiByte
This research directly supports IndiByte's mission by highlighting:
- The systemic mismatch between global dietary standards and Indian food patterns
- The need for culturally appropriate dietary recommendations
- The importance of addressing carbohydrate quality in Indian diets
- The necessity of region-specific nutritional guidance

## Impact on IndiByte's Approach
The findings support IndiByte's core principles:
- Need for India-first food database with comprehensive nutritional data
- Importance of cultural alignment in dietary recommendations
- Economic accessibility of healthy food alternatives
- Medical accuracy in food recommendations

## Research Implications
- Demonstrates the inadequacy of Western-based dietary guidelines for Indian populations
- Supports the need for personalized nutrition recommendations based on Indian foods
- Validates the approach of using ICMR-validated sources for medical claims
- Highlights the importance of considering regional dietary preferences and restrictions

## Data Sources and Methodology
- Based on ICMR-INDIAB survey data
- Sample size: 18,090 adults across India
- Comprehensive dietary recall analysis
- Nutritional assessment against ICMR standards
