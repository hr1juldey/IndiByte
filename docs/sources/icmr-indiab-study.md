# ICMR-INDIAB Study (Indian Council of Medical Research - India Diabetes)

## Overview

The ICMR-INDIAB (Indian Council of Medical Research - India Diabetes) study is a comprehensive national survey examining diabetes prevalence, dietary patterns, and metabolic risk factors across India. This large-scale study provides critical data for understanding India's unique nutritional and health challenges, which is directly relevant to IndiByte's mission of providing culturally appropriate dietary recommendations.

## Key Details

- **Study Name**: Indian Council of Medical Research - India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB)
- **Scope**: National-level survey across India
- **Sample Size**: Over 18,000 adults studied in recent publications
- **Focus Areas**: Diabetes prevalence, dietary patterns, metabolic risk factors

## Key Findings

- Diabetes prevalence varies significantly across Indian states (4.8% in Uttar Pradesh to 26.4% in Goa)
- Indians derive up to 75% of their calories from carbohydrates, primarily from white rice, refined wheat, and added sugar
- Carbohydrate-heavy dietary patterns contribute to diabetes risk in the Indian population
- Regional dietary patterns significantly influence health outcomes

## Significance for IndiByte

The ICMR-INDIAB study provides crucial epidemiological data that supports IndiByte's approach to personalized nutrition recommendations for diabetes management. The study's findings about Indian dietary patterns and diabetes prevalence validate the need for culturally appropriate nutritional guidance that IndiByte provides.

The study's insights into regional variations in diabetes prevalence and dietary patterns align with IndiByte's approach of incorporating regional food preferences and cultural context into nutritional recommendations.

## Dietary Insights

- Carbohydrate-heavy diets (up to 75% of calories) in India
- Regional variations in food consumption patterns
- Traditional dietary patterns vs. modern dietary shifts
- Impact of processed foods on metabolic health

## Research Applications

- Development of region-specific dietary guidelines
- Understanding of Indian diabetes epidemiology
- Basis for culturally appropriate nutritional interventions
- Reference for diabetes management in Indian populations

## References

- Multiple publications from the ICMR-INDIAB study series (ICMR-INDIAB-21 being the 21st paper)
- Used as a reference in diabetes management guidelines for India
- Forms the basis for understanding India's unique nutritional challenges
