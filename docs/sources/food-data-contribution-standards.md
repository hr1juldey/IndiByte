# Food Data Contribution Standards and Methodology

## Overview
Food data contribution standards and methodologies ensure the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of nutritional databases. These standards are essential for creating trustworthy food composition databases that can be used for research, clinical applications, and public health initiatives.

## Key Standards and Guidelines

### International Standards
- FAO/INFOODS guidelines for food composition databases
- ISO standards for analytical methods
- Codex Alimentarius food standards
- WHO guidelines for nutritional assessment

### Data Quality Requirements
- Source verification from reliable and authoritative sources
- Multiple source cross-referencing for validation
- Standardized units of measurement (g, mg, mcg, IU)
- Documentation of analytical methods used
- Uncertainty and confidence intervals reporting

## Data Collection Methodology
- Laboratory analysis using standardized protocols
- Compilation from peer-reviewed literature
- Government and institutional databases
- Manufacturer data with verification
- Traditional knowledge with scientific validation

## Quality Assurance
- Expert review by nutritionists and dietitians
- Cross-validation with international databases
- Regular updates and corrections
- Transparency in data sources and methods
- Peer review processes

## Nutritional Data Categories
- Macronutrients: energy, protein, carbohydrates, fats
- Micronutrients: vitamins and minerals
- Bioactive compounds: antioxidants, phytochemicals
- Amino acid profiles
- Fatty acid composition
