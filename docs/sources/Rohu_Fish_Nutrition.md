## Relevance to IndiByte
Rohu fish exemplifies the type of culturally appropriate, nutritionally valuable food that IndiByte aims to highlight. The document mentions Rohu as an example of how Western recommendations (like suggesting salmon) may not be appropriate for Indian coastal communities who traditionally consume Rohu. This supports IndiByte's approach of recommending locally available, culturally appropriate, and economically accessible foods instead of suggesting expensive Western alternatives. The high omega-3 content validates the nutritional value of traditional Indian fish varieties.
