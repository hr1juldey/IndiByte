# Regional Indian Food Variations and Nutritional Diversity

## Overview

India's diverse geography, climate, culture, and history have given rise to distinct regional food traditions, each with unique ingredients, cooking methods, and nutritional profiles. Understanding these regional variations is crucial for developing culturally appropriate and nutritionally accurate food databases like the IndiByte API.
