# ICMR Indian Food Composition Tables: A Critical Resource for Nutrition Research

## Overview

The Indian Food Composition Tables (IFCT) published by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) through the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) represent a comprehensive compilation of nutritional information for 528 key Indian foods. This database serves as a foundational resource for nutrition research, public health initiatives, and the development of nutrition-based applications and systems in India.

## Key Features

- Contains laboratory-verified nutrient information for 528 key Indian foods
- Widely used by researchers, academics, and public health professionals
- Provides essential data for nutrition analysis and dietary planning
- Supports evidence-based nutrition recommendations in India

## Relevance to IndiByte

The ICMR IFCT serves as a critical authoritative source for the IndiByte project, providing:

- Verified nutritional data that can be integrated into the platform
- A foundation for ensuring accuracy in food composition information
- A standard reference for validating community-contributed data
- Essential information for building personalized nutrition recommendations

## Technical Considerations

For systems like IndiByte that aim to provide comprehensive nutrition information for India:

- Integration with ICMR data ensures compliance with national standards
- The database provides a baseline for nutritional values that can be supplemented with community contributions
- Regular updates to the IFCT should be incorporated into the system design
- The data structure of IFCT can inform the database schema design for similar systems

## Research Applications

The IFCT has been extensively used in:

- Nutrition research studies
- Public health policy development
- Clinical nutrition applications
- Food industry product development
- Academic nutrition education
