# ICMR-INDIAB Survey: Indian Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders Study

## Overview

The Indian Council of Medical Research - India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) survey is a comprehensive nationwide study examining diabetes prevalence and metabolic disorders across India. The study provides critical data on dietary patterns, their relationship to health outcomes, and regional variations in dietary habits.

## Key Details

- **Study scope**: National survey covering multiple states and regions in India
- **Sample size**: 18,090 adults studied for dietary profiles
- **Primary focus**: Diabetes prevalence and associated metabolic risk factors
- **Secondary focus**: Dietary patterns and their impact on health outcomes
- **Publishing body**: Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN)

## Key Findings

- **Diabetes prevalence**: Varies widely from 4.8% in Uttar Pradesh to 26.4% in Goa
- **Regional patterns**: Higher rates in southern and western states
- **Dietary characteristics**: Indian diets are characterized by high intakes of low-quality carbohydrates (white rice, milled whole grains, and added sugar)
- **Nutritional profile**: Concerns about high-carb and low-protein dietary patterns
- **Health impacts**: Link between traditional dietary patterns and rising metabolic disorders

## Dietary Patterns Identified

- **Carbohydrate-heavy diets**: Predominantly rice and wheat-based meals
- **Low protein intake**: Below recommended levels in many regions
- **Regional variations**: Significant differences in dietary patterns across states
- **Urban vs rural differences**: Changing dietary habits with urbanization
- **Processed food consumption**: Increasing trend with associated health risks

## Significance for IndiByte API

The ICMR-INDIAB survey provides crucial insights that directly support the IndiByte API's objectives:

1. **Medical condition focus**: Data supports diabetes and hypertension-specific dietary recommendations
2. **Regional dietary patterns**: Information on state-wise dietary differences
3. **Evidence-based recommendations**: Scientific backing for condition-specific food suggestions
4. **Population health approach**: Supports the API's zero-cost access for public health initiatives
5. **Cultural dietary context**: Understanding of traditional food consumption patterns

## Data Applications

The survey findings are relevant for:

- Developing condition-specific food filters (diabetes, hypertension)
- Creating regional dietary recommendations
- Understanding nutritional deficiencies in Indian populations
- Informing personalized nutrition algorithms
- Supporting evidence-based dietary counseling

## Research Applications

- Policy development for national nutrition programs
- Clinical guidelines for managing diabetes and metabolic disorders
- Public health interventions targeting dietary patterns
- Development of culturally appropriate dietary recommendations
- Validation of nutrition assessment tools and databases
