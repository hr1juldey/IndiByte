# Economic Aspects of Indian Dietary Patterns vs Western Foods

## Overview

The economic cost of traditional Indian foods versus Western dietary recommendations presents a significant barrier to following generic nutritional advice in India. The cost differential often makes Western recommendations inaccessible to the majority of the population.

## Cost Comparison Data

- **Toor Dal**: Approximately ₹30/kg
- **Chicken**: Approximately ₹250/kg
- **Salmon**: Approximately ₹450/kg (imported, expensive)
- **Paneer**: More economical alternative to salmon for protein
- **Traditional thali meals**: Significantly more affordable than Western "healthy" alternatives

## Economic Impact on Dietary Compliance

- Suggesting "Western vegan meals" instead of lentil-based Indian dishes results in 3× higher cost
- Generic "healthy" delivery foods (like avocado toast) are often unaffordable for average consumers
- Traditional Indian dishes like "Healthy Chole Bhature" (₹65) offer better value than generic "healthy" options
- Home-cooked vegetarian thalis cost significantly less than Western alternatives

## Food Cost Trends in India

- Food costs represent approximately 46% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket in India
- This is more than double that of the U.S. or EU, making cost a critical factor in dietary choices
- Home-cooked vegetarian thalis dropped 17% in cost year-on-year in October 2024
- Non-vegetarian thalis dropped 12% in cost year-on-year in the same period

## Economic Implications for Health Outcomes

- High cost of Western dietary recommendations contributes to poor adherence (only 8% of patients follow generic advice)
- Economically appropriate recommendations have higher success rates
- Cloud kitchens using culturally aligned, budget-friendly menus see 22% higher orders
- Cost-effective alternatives like "Kadhi" (₹50) vs. chicken broth (₹150) provide better nutrition at lower cost

## Relevance to IndiByte

The economic data strongly supports IndiByte's approach of providing cost-effective, culturally appropriate dietary recommendations. The document highlights that economic exclusion is a major issue with Western dietary standards, and IndiByte addresses this by providing economically tiered information (e.g., "Toor Dal: ₹30/kg (vs. chicken ₹250/kg)"). This economic consideration is crucial for the platform's success in reaching 1.7 billion Indians, as dietary recommendations must be financially accessible to be practically implementable.
