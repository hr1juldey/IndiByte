# ICMR Expert Group Report on Nutrient Requirements for Indians (2020)

## Overview

The ICMR-NIN Expert Group on Nutrient Requirements for Indians published comprehensive Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) in 2020. This report represents a significant update to India-specific nutritional guidelines and requirements.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Indian population
- Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) based on Indian dietary patterns
- Updated guidelines accounting for modern Indian eating habits
- Addresses specific nutritional needs of different age groups and physiological conditions

## Key Findings and Recommendations

- Addresses the high-carb and low-protein nature of traditional Indian diets
- Provides guidelines for micronutrient requirements specific to Indian food patterns
- Emphasizes the need for protein and fiber to balance traditional Indian dietary patterns
- Links high-carbohydrate Indian diets to rising obesity and diabetes rates

## Health Implications

The report highlights several critical health impacts of current Indian dietary patterns:

1. Higher risk of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes
2. Faster progression to insulin resistance
3. Nutritional deficiencies despite adequate caloric intake
4. Need for dietary diversification with more protein and fiber

## Relevance to IndiByte

This report validates the IndiByte approach of focusing on India-specific nutritional guidelines rather than adapting Western recommendations. The report's findings support the document's assertion that "72% of Indian dietitians admit to adapting Western guidelines (NHS Survey 2022), yet only 8% of patients follow them due to cultural incompatibility." The ICMR report emphasizes the need for locally-appropriate dietary guidelines, which is exactly what IndiByte aims to provide through its open-source platform.
