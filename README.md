## Overview

Most global dietary standards are based on European/American food patterns, creating systemic mismatches for India's 1.7 billion people. 72% of Indian dietitians admit to adapting Western guidelines (NHS Survey 2022), yet only 8% of patients follow them due to cultural incompatibility.

IndiByte addresses this critical gap by providing a unified, open-source platform standardizing **Indian food science** for all users.

**Vision**: *"Your plate, standardized. Your health, personalized."*
